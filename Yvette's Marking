##General Comments

- Are all of the method's and features included required for the spec? 
    - e.g. Passenger/Coach/Train/Station reporting statuses
    - Stop method
    

- README could have instructions from usage (methods of objects, rules, etc)


##Bugs

- User can board coach that is not at station, without touching in.
- User can alight from a train to a station that the train is not at
    - e.g. Sandrine is on a train at Old Street. If you call sandrine.alight_station(train.coaches[0].kings_cross) then it adds Sandrine to Kings Cross Station


##Refactoring
- On Train 'transit' method, the user has to enter the origin, despite the train knowing what station it is in.
    train.rb, Line 39
    ````
    def transit(origin, destination)
      exit(origin)
      enter(destination)
    end
    ````
    Could be:
    ````
    def transit(destination)
      exit(@station)
      enter(destination)
    end
    ````

- Could add attr_reader to replace:
    - Train's 'coaches' method
- Could use attr_accessor to replace:
    - User's 'in_station?', 'in_coach' and 'in_train' methods
    - UserContainer's 'capacity' and 'capacity=(value)'
